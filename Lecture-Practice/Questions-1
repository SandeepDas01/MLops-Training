#1. Read the data for January. How many columns are there?


#2. Now let's compute the duration variable. It should contain the duration of a ride in minutes.
What's the standard deviation of the trips duration in January?

#3. we need to check the distribution of the duration variable. There are some outliers. Let's remove them and keep only the records 
# where the duration was between 1 and 60 minutes (inclusive).
# What fraction of the records left after you dropped the outliers?

#4.
#Let's apply one-hot encoding to the pickup and dropoff location IDs. We'll use only these two features for our model.
#Turn the dataframe into a list of dictionaries (remember to re-cast the ids to strings - otherwise it will label encode them)
#Fit a dictionary vectorizer
#Get a feature matrix from it

#5.Now let's use the feature matrix from the previous step to train a model.

#Train a plain linear regression model with default parameters, where duration is the response variable
#Calculate the RMSE of the model on the training data
#What's the RMSE on train?



#6. Now let's apply this model to the validation dataset (February 2023).
#What's the RMSE on validation?
